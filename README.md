## How I worked on this project

My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.

- I worked with tasks on a Kanban board: [Screenshot of tasks]
- I used feature branches and Pull Requests: [Link to example PR]

## How to navigate this project

- Somewhat complex stateful logic: [Link to example code on GitHub]
- Responsive CSS using styled-components: [Link to example code on GitHub]
- The application fetches data from the XZY API: Examples for the request [link to code on
  GitHub] and data transformation [link to code on GitHub]
- Integration tests using React Testing Library: [Link to example test on GitHub]

## Why I built the project this way

- I didn't use a state management library like Redux on purpose. For this app simple `useState` is
  sufficient. I realized that more and more projects don't use Redux anymore since GraphQL or
  react-query are often used for data management.
- styled-components is a great library for styling. It includes an auto-prefixer, uses scoped
  classes, and allows a seamless integration with JS.
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer eventually. But for the beginning I focus on the
  frontend. That's why I decided to use an existing API rather to create a custom server. I have
  basic backend knowledge as well.
- Testing is an essential part of production applications. Testing Library is the go-to library in the
  React community. I covered the essential features of the app with tests.

## If I had more time I would change this

- Set up continuous integration to run the tests and ESLint on every Pull Request
- Refactor some of the code. Especially this part [link to code on GitHub]
- Add end-to-end tests with Cypress.
